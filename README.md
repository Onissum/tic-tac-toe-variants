## Getting Started

To get started with the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Onissum/tic-tac-toe-variants.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tic-tac-toe`.
3. Run the game: `python tic_tac_toe.py`.

## How to Play

- Launch the game, and you'll be presented with a 3x3 grid.
- The first player is "X," and the second player is "O."
- Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell by clicking on it.
- The game continues until one player wins by forming a line of their symbol horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the game ends in a draw.

## AI Opponent

- Choose the "VS.AI" option to play against a computer opponent.
- The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make its moves, providing a challenging game experience.

## Running on Google Colab

- If you want to play with a friend on Google Colab, use the `tic_tac_toe_colab_version(by_AI_HELP).ipynb` notebook.
- Open the notebook in Google Colab and follow the instructions to start a two-player game.
